						Go Project Diary

16 February 2016
----------------
1 hour.
We had our first meeting with our supervisor, Henrik. We scrapped our other ideas and decided to make a Go game.
We started to plan the making of a thorough design before starting with the actual coding.


17 February 2016
----------------
About 4 hours.
Today We worked on the design of the project and we got a small tutorial on how to use github.


18 February 2016
----------------
2.5 hours.
We continued to work on the design to get it finished. We decided to divide the coding of the project into two parts.
The first part would be about the game board and pieces(stones) with the basic rules of the game, and the second part 
would be about the more advanced rules of the game.


19 February 2016
----------------
About 2.5 hours.
Today we had a meeting with our supervisor were we discussed on how to make our board. We decided to make a list of 
lists and started working on creating our board.


22 February 2016
----------------
3.5 hours.
We had a short meeting with Henrik today were he helped us fix the function to create our board. After the meeting we
continued with the code for our board functions.


23 February 2016
----------------
3.5 hours.
Today we got the function with the purpose of finding out if a spot on the board is empty or has a stone on it to work. We 
continued to work on different functions trying to figure out how to replace an element in a list of lists.


24 February 2016
----------------
3.5 hours.
Today we continued tweaking on the functions to replace elements in lists. It works great just replacing an element in a 
single list but it gets tricky when we want to use the funcion in a list of lists.


25 February 2016
----------------
2.5 hours.
We tried make the element replacing function to work but we got stuck so we asked our supervisor for some help
and we finally got it to work.
