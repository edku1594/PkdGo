Project diary - Marie Paulsson

When: 15/2-16 at Jeppes place
How long: 1-1,5h in total (between 17:45ish - 20:30ish with breaks)
What did i do: Coming up with some ideas (a Go game, chess, four in a row, make a scheme and save it in a library),
made a scheme over project-deadlines and divided the game Go in smaller problems (that i could think of).


  Graphic window: (Least prio)
- Get a window
- Clickable
- Arrays (e.g. matrix of 9x9, the Go board)
- Start the game
- Quit/exit the game
- Black/white stones
- Give up?/Pass
- The game is over when both players pass

  Player:
- Is it the players turn? (check if it is)
- Place a stone on a position that is empty
- Click for position or write?

  Go logic:
- If the position is empty (check for stones)
- Know if it is a ko (an endless battle)
- Can the stone (which recently has been positioned) be killed by the opponent? (dubblecheck)
- Know if a group of stones are dead or killed
- Count points for stones and territorium (at the end of the game)
- Know the difference between black and white stones
- Winner and loser

  Game settings:
- Timer?
- Handicap
- Player vs Player or Player vs AI/Bot
- Difficulty or different approach for the AI/Bot (Passive(take territoriums) or aggressive(take battles))
- Network client? -> A chat

  For the AI/Bot:
- Keep a track of points
- Place a stone on an empty position
- Some sort of priority for placing the stones (take territoriums or battles etc.)
- Or place stones at random?

When: 16/2-16 at ITC 2240
How long: 1h (at 11-12am)
What did i do: Had our first tutorial with our supervisor, decided that we will do a Go game. Had a little discussion about what to do.
Decided to meet 17/2 to do a design and a new meeting at 19/2.

-------------------------------------------------------------

when: 17/2-16 at foobar
How long: 12:20-16
what did i do: We learned basics on how to use GitHub, we came up with a fundamental desgin plan for our Go project with some overview/help from our supervisor.

-------------------------------------------------------------

when: 18/2-16 in 2241
How long: 15:15-18
what did i do: We continued to plan our design and discussed different types of scenarios, groups and liberties in Go. Did just a little bit of coding.

-------------------------------------------------------------

when: 19/2-16 in 2240,
How long: 11-13:40
what did i do: Had a meeting with our supervisor (which i was late to) and after we struggled with how to create list of lists, searched around on the internet and looked on
some chess code to get some ideas. Did just a little bit of coding.

---------------------------------------------------------------

When: 22/2-16 in 2240
How long: 13:25 - 17:16, 17:45 - 18:40 (on the train)
what did i do: Had a short short meeting with our supervisor who helped us with the function initialBoard. After he left we coded getCell and oppositeCell. We didn't finish playMove and isEmpty.
Later when i was on the train to Stockholm i put some comments on the code at lines: 22, 24, 37 and 38. I deleted 3 files (Dairy, GO project and untitled) because they were unnecessary and added GoDocumentation to our github.

----------------------------------------------------------------

When: 23/2-16 in 2226
How long: 13:30 - 17:15 & 17:45-18:40 (on the train) & 1h at Jeppes.
What did i do: We fixed the funtion isEmpty (we needed to add deriving Eq at line 13 for isEmpty to work which took some time to notice) and Eda worked on playStone.
I'm working on replaceCell, trying to figure out how to replace an element in a list of lists with a new value. Can't figure out how to apply take and drop on list of lists, so that it doesn't remove the whole n:th list in list of lists 
but just the n:th element in that list.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

When: 24/2-16
How long: 15:00 - 18:50
What did i do: I tried to write replaceList, we summoned our supervisor who helped us a little and then I fixed the function replaceElement

-----------------------------------------------------------------

When: 25/2-16
How long: 12:00-15:20 in foobar, 17:20-18:00
What did i do: I was working alone for 1,5h and thought i fixed replaceCell but it was wrong and got stuck. Later we summoned our supervisor who helped us and now on the train i fixed the function!!
Note: Joel and Eda also fixed replaceCell when i left, i just pushed mine to our repository.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

when: 26/2-16
How long: 13:05-17:20ish
What did i do: We looked at Nim.hs to get some inspiration and an understanding of how it works. Also read the slides 27-29 to understand IO more. I took the readMove function from Nim.hs and i tried to do a playStone function.
Saved my version as placeStone.hs.

------------------------------------------------------------------

When: 28/2-16
How long: 01:20-03:06 & 10:30-11:50 at Jeppes, 14:05-15:00 p√• pendeln, 15:50-18:00 at Joels, 21:40-01:00 the next day at home
What did i do: I started writing in our documentation. I did the first page and wrote about Go under Introduction. When I woke up I made some changes in placeStone.hs and tried to make a working placeStone function.
At the train i made the function placeStone work.
Working at Joels place with Joel on placeStone.hs. Made a new file called Game.hs with new working functions main and play (I did all the coding on my laptop, Joels broke the otherday).
Once at home I made playerOne/Two functions and the play function to loop non-stop if you don't put a too high or low index. I figured the error occurs in the getCell function saying that the index is too large or negative, don't really know how to
fix it yet. Even made some name changes on some functions (like placeStone are now playerOne and playerTwo). Saved the file as GameLoop.hs.
