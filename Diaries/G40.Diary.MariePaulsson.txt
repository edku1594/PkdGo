Project diary - Marie Paulsson

When: 15/2-16 at Jeppes place
How long: 1-1,5h in total (between 17:45ish - 20:30ish with breaks)
What did i do: Coming up with some ideas (a Go game, chess, four in a row, make a scheme and save it in a library),
made a scheme over project-deadlines and divided the game Go in smaller problems (that i could think of).


  Graphic window: (Least prio)
- Get a window
- Clickable
- Arrays (e.g. matrix of 9x9, the Go board)
- Start the game
- Quit/exit the game
- Black/white stones
- Give up?/Pass
- The game is over when both players pass

  Player:
- Is it the players turn? (check if it is)
- Place a stone on a position that is empty
- Click for position or write?

  Go logic:
- If the position is empty (check for stones)
- Know if it is a ko (an endless battle)
- Can the stone (which recently has been positioned) be killed by the opponent? (dubblecheck)
- Know if a group of stones are dead or killed
- Count points for stones and territorium (at the end of the game)
- Know the difference between black and white stones
- Winner and loser

  Game settings:
- Timer?
- Handicap
- Player vs Player or Player vs AI/Bot
- Difficulty or different approach for the AI/Bot (Passive(take territoriums) or aggressive(take battles))
- Network client? -> A chat

  For the AI/Bot:
- Keep a track of points
- Place a stone on an empty position
- Some sort of priority for placing the stones (take territoriums or battles etc.)
- Or place stones at random?
